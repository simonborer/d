        <p>I can't stress this enough, as much as it pains me to say it: "it's not what you know, it's who you know".</p>

        <p>Being someone that people want to work with will help you more than any training, credentials, or certification. It helps if you can prove that you can do the job. But it helps <em>more</em> if people like you.</p>
        <p>Why is this painful to say? Because I like to think that my field can be a refuge for awkward people, for shy people, and, ideally, for people who have traditionally been discriminated against. You can't argue with good code.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
            <h3>{{"That last sentence was a lie." | allGas | safe }}</h3>
            <p>You definitely <em>can</em> argue with good code, and this was proven in a sample size of about 330,000 people.</p>
            <p>For context, a "pull request" is something that happens when people collaborate on code. You write a chunk of code on your own, and then make a request that it be merged into the shared code.</p>
            <p>{% ext "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170501094343.htm" %}Researchers looked at 3 million{% endext %}(!) pull requests, and found that...</p>

                <li>...women with profiles where their gender was identifiable had the lowest acceptance rate for their code (58%)</li>
                <li>...men with gender-neutral profiles had an acceptance rate of 65%, and men with gender-identifiable profiles had an acceptance rate of 61%.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm not sure exactly why <em>all</em> gender-identifiable profiles had a lower acceptance rate, but the magnitude of the difference in the gap for men and the gap for women definitely indicates a widespread bias.</p>
