        <h2>Design Conventions</h2>
        <p>Sometimes the person tasked with the web design phase finds themselves without a proper style guide, appropriate existing layouts, or explicit layout requirements.</p>
        <p>Non-traditional, experimental design can be wonderful, exciting, and rewarding. However, you also have to contend with deadlines, client expectations, and users who just want to find out what time the library closes, goshdarnit.</p>
        <p>It's at this point that a web designer (or someone pretending to be a web designer) asks - <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--emphasis)">what is the normal thing to do?</span></p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>As a rule, users are best served by designs and layouts that are <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">intuitive</span> - meaning that they can <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline" data-ann-color="var(--warning)">easily recognize interactive elements</span>, and <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline" data-ann-color="var(--warning)">where to find the information</span> they're looking for.</p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>Most of these conventions are not just tried-and-true, they're based on a simple principle: <strong>people scan site content in a particular order</strong>.</p>

    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>People will scan your website starting in the corner where they would start reading a page of text. They continue scanning from the initial side, going less and less far across the page the further down they go. This is know as the '<strong>F-Pattern</strong>'.</p>
        <p class="callout warning">Remember that <strong>not all people read from left to right</strong>! Readers of Arabic, Hebrew, Pashto, Persian, Urdu, and Sindhi read horizontally right to left, and readers of Chinese, Japanese and Korean scripts read vertically from right to left. <strong>Know your audience.</strong></p>

            <li>
                <p><h2 data-annotate>{{ toc[4].title | allGas | safe}}</h2>. One guide for this could be the F-pattern we discussed earlier. Another high-priority pattern is choosing what content should be <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--alert)">"above the fold".</span></p>
                <p>This is a term that dates back to newprint - top headlines were kept in the top half of the page, above where the newspaper would be folded in half horizontally. In the early days of the web, people <em>did not scroll</em> web pages. Like, at all, basically.</p>

        <p>This has changed... somewhat.</p>

        <p>Add to that the fact that responsive design means there is <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">no exact spot where the "fold" will be</span> for users. Nonetheless, it's a good rule to follow that <span data-annotate>the higher up the content is, the better the chance users will actually see it.</span></p>

    <p>Those are the big ones! Web design truisms that you can hang your hat on. Of course, there are all kinds of smaller conventions that we can take for granted (â˜°&nbsp;hamburger menu, anyone?), but these 6 standard approaches to page design are enough to get you started.</p>
