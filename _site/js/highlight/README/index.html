<h1>Highlight.js CDN Assets</h1>
<p><a href="https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=highlight.js"><img src="https://packagephobia.now.sh/badge?p=highlight.js" alt="install size"></a></p>
<p><strong>This package contains only the CDN build assets of highlight.js.</strong></p>
<p>This may be what you want if you'd like to install the pre-built distributable highlight.js client-side assets via NPM. If you're wanting to use highlight.js mainly on the server-side you likely want the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/highlight.js">highlight.js</a> package instead.</p>
<p>To access these files via CDN:<br>
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@latest/build/</p>
<p><strong>If you just want a single .js file with the common languages built-in:
<a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@latest/build/highlight.min.js">https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@latest/build/highlight.min.js</a></strong></p>
