        <h2>Just how much carbon are we talking?</h2>
        <p>I've actually found that this is a hard number to pin down. Here's what I can tell you:</p>
    </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>In 2018, Mozilla reported that internet data centres alone produced <strong>roughly the same carbon emissions as <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-internet-uses-more-electricity-than/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the airline industry<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a></strong> - about 2% of total emissions.</p>
        <p>This number doesn't factor in all the other devices that form the client end of the web - phones, laptops, personal computers, TVs, watches, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/brita-infinity-wi-fi-connected-pitcher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">water pitchers<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, <a href="https://www.lavviebot.com/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">litterboxes<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/kerastase-hair-coach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hairbrushes<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, et al.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>At the beginning of 2019, French "post-carbon economy think tank" The Shift Project estimated the total share of global emissions created by the internet to be <a href="https://theshiftproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lean-ICT-Report_The-Shift-Project_2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">3.7%<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> of the <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/co2-emissions-from-energy-combustion-and-industrial-processes-1900-2021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">36.1 billion metric tons<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> emitted globally, (for a total of about 1.3 billion tons), but that number still doesn't capture the seismic changes in the world over the past three years.</p>

    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>Carbon emissions dipped in 2020, only to rebound in 2021, while work-from-home, streaming and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">web3<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>" technologies made major changes to the internet's energy consumption.

        <p>Actually some good news here: I had assumed that streaming media would be really gnarly for the environment, having read some scary articles a few years back.

        <h3>Remote work</h3>
        <p>Remote work is still, as of this writing, the subject of a lot of unsettled questions.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <h4>Remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic.</h4>
        <p>While 2020 was a <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/annual-change-in-co2-emissions-from-energy-combustion-and-industrial-processes-1900-2021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">great year for carbon emission reduction<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, with a global reduction of 1.86 gigatonnes from 2019, we bounced back in 2021 in the worst possible way.</p>
        <p>I heard murmurs that this was because so many of us were working from home, but that might not be the case.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>Throughout the 20th, and into the 21st century, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions were strongly correlated with <abbr title="gross domestic product">GDP</abbr>.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>However, the rebound in carbon emissions from 2019 to 2020 suggests that CO<sup>2</sup> emissions are less about <em>where</em> people work, and more about <em>whether</em> they work.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>That said, where <em>are</em> people going to be working in the years to come?</p>
        <p>In America, the vast majority of people who worked remotely due to COVID-19 are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-remote-workers-declining-may-2022-rcna28499#20220512-work-remote" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">back in the workplace<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>. In Canada, "only one half (50%) of Canadians currently working from home envision themselves returning to the office with any regularity in 2022", according to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/only-half-of-Canadians-say-they-expect-to-return-to-office#:~:text=Toronto%2C%20ON%2C%20December%2026%2C,Ipsos%20poll%20conducted%20on%20behalf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">an Ipsos poll<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>So what does that mean for carbon emissions? While the future of remote work is uncertain, we can definitely say the that working from home is (according to a meta-analysis published in the journal <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>) <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8a84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">kinda good, maybe, sometimes, for the most part<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>
        <p>Turns out that, while reducing commuting is good for the planet, those gains can be partially (or even wholly) offset by other secondary effects like buying new, <a href="https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/research/publications/rare-earth-elements-a-resource-constraint-of-the-energy-transition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">rare earth element intensive<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> home office equipment and home energy use, and an increase in non-work-related travel. The benefits of reduced commutes are smallest in places where there's good public transit, where the reduced ridership can negatively impact lower-emissions transportation.</p>
        <p>In short, this is a hard topic upon which to draw any firm conclusions, particularly, the authors of the meta-analysis note, as work itself becomes harder to pin down. The shift to the "gig economy", contract work, and the expectation in the modern workplace of 24/7 availability - a deliberate blurring of the lines between working and doing literally anything else - makes it hard to determine when someone's carbon emissions are work-related.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>To summarize: it's a <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--emphasis)">very good thing when people don't drive to work</span>, but those benefits are only as good as the sustainability of <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--alert)">our home office equipment, public transit and electrical grid</span>.</p>

    <div data-slide class="row">
        <h3>Web3: Blockchain, Crypto and NFTs</h3>
        <p>Finally, <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--alert)">a true villain</span>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">"Web3"<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> is a somewhat vague buzzword for blockchain-based... stuff. Blockchain is a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">technology that allows for the decentralized verification of ownership and transaction histories<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>. In other words, everybody gets a copy of a document that shows who owns what and where they got it. This is the technology that underlies most cryptocurrencies ("crypto") and non-fungible tokens ("NFTs"). While web3 is hazy and a bit speculative at the moment, we <em>do</em> have some understanding of NFTs and crypto.</p>
        <h4>Crypto's environmental footpring</h4>
        <p class="callout warning">Full disclosure: I may not know what I'm talking about here. This is a complex topic, so please understand that this is an amateur's best effort at understanding some complicated stuff, and take my words with a grain of salt. I promise I'll update this section if I understand this better in the future.</p>
        <p>Okay, so, best as I can tell - the integrity of a cryptocurrency's blockchain relies on a process called "Proof of Work", wherein there is a bit of a lottery, where the reward is crypto, but you get more lottery tickets based on how much computational power you expend. Do I fully understand how maxing GPUs, solving arbitrary, <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">progressively harder<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> computational problems for Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp#toc-proof-of-work-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">somehow verifies transactions<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">prevents spam email<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> for that matter)? Nope. However, the expenditure of computational resources results in the verification of transactions (somehow), and miners receive a free for transactions they verify (I'm reasonably certain).</p>
        <p>What I <em>do</em> know is that running a competition to see who can push the most computers harder and harder over time has not been great for carbon emissions. Researchers estimate that Bitcoin mining (not including all other cryptocurrencies) in 2021 alone was responsible for about <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358861058_Revisiting_Bitcoin%27s_carbon_footprint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">65.4 million tonnes of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> - roughly the same as the <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/carbon-footprint-by-country#dataTable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">entire country of Austria<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>. (However, let's keep it in context - 65.4 million is still only 4.9% of 1.3 billion.)</p>
        <p>Another verification method, called Proof of Stake ("PoS"), basically requires you to put up crypto you already own as collateral for the accuracy of your version of the verification ledger. Proof of stake is less energy intensive, but hasn't been widely adopted among cryptocurrencies (although Ethereum, the next largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, is <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">planning to switch over to PoS<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>).</p>
        <p>Ethereum is an important part of the NFT market. The Ethereum blockchain enabled "smart contracts" in 2017, which lead to the NFT market of today. These smart contracts aren't necessarily contracts in the traditional sense, but the execution of a computer function on the blockchain itself, meaning that you can trade something more complex than a "coin" (a coin being, in essence, a series of alphanumeric characters).  This opened the door to trading non-fungible tokens. NFTs are digital goods, which... well, they're also a series of alphanumeric characters, but when an NFT is traded, you're executing a smart contract where the <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-nonfungible-tokens-work-and-where-they-get-their-value-a-cryptocurrency-expert-explains-nfts-157489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">digital signature of the file<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> (rather than the entirety of the code) is authenticated. I'm pretty sure.</p>
        <p>How much carbon does Ethereum currently produce? Probably about <a href="https://kylemcdonald.github.io/ethereum-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">7.9 million tonnes per year<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> - a fraction of Bitcoin's carbon footprint, but a lot more than nothing (and, hopefully, about 1000 times as much as it <em>will</em> produce after the <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/05/27/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-proof-of-stake-environment-carbon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">long-awaited<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> switch to Proof-of-Stake).</p>
        <p>What percentage of that is due to NFTs? This is not something I could find a lot of sources on. ARTnews <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/nft-carbon-environmental-impact-1234589742/#:~:text=represent%20a%20very%20small%20portion%20of%20Ethereum%20transactions%20overall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">cites estimates ranging from 1%-2.5%<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> of Ethereum transactions being NFT exchanges (the vast majority of the remaining percentage being trades of Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether, a.k.a. ETH).</p>
        <p>But here's where we draw what some people claim as an important distinction - mining vs. transactions. Mining, i.e. the computationally expensive proof-of-work, is the #1 source of crypto's carbon emissions by orders of magnitude. The transactions themselves create a fairly negligible amount of emissions. The mining creates the <em>capacity</em> for the transactions, and the number of transactions doesn't directly affect the size of crypto's carbon footprint.</p>
        <p>That being said, the transactions result in fees paid to the miners, who are incentivized to build out the capacity of the network through Proof of Work. Essentially, this capacity is what results in the massive carbon footprint of blockchain technologies. The reason it's tough to come up with a number to represent the carbon emissions per NFT is that the carbon emissions will still happen without the transactions, but the reason for the carbon emissions is because the transactions incentivize the capacity building.</p>
        <blockquote>
            If you’re on the plane, you’re obviously responsible for a portion of its emissions. But if you hadn’t bought the ticket, the plane probably would have taken off with other passengers and polluted the same amount anyway... If enough people decide to start flying who weren’t planning to before, an airline might decide to operate more flights — which means more emissions overall.

        <h2>What can we do about it?</h2>
        <p>Okay, to recap:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There's good reasons to not give up on the good ol' planet earth.</li>
            <li>It's good to make some personal changes, but some matter way more than others.</li>
            <li>It's most important to push for systemic changes.</li>
            <li>Watching TV is okay, or making tea is not, depending on how you look at it.</li>
            <li>Working from home won't save the world.</li>
            <li>Improving energy efficiency of big consumers (like internet data centres) has a massive impact on carbon emissions.</li>
            <li>Bitcoin is really, really bad for the environment, and probably won't get better any time soon. But it still only accounts for less than 5% of the internet's total carbon emissions.</li>
            <li>NFTs aren't <em>great</em>, but they're a tiny fraction of the crypto world, and are likely to be less energy intensive in the near future.</li>
            <li>"Web3" is vague and kinda sketchy.</li>
