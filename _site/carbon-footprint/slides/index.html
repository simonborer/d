    <p>Climate change is a <em>massive</em> topic, so I feel inclined to frame the conversation a bit. When talking about a globe- and epoch-spanning issue, there are things we can affect, and things we can't. Most conversations around climate change are specifically about this: <span data-annotate>what, if anything, can be done, and by whom?</span></p>

        <h3>Lifestyle activism is pretty much a scam.</h3>

    </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>Now <em>of course</em> there are things we can do in our own lives that will reduce the amount of carbon emitted by people - mostly <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/article/four-lifestyle-choices-most-reduce-your-carbon-footprint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">avoiding flying, driving, and eating meat<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>

        <h2>Just how much carbon are we talking?</h2>
        <p>I've actually found that this is a hard number to pin down. Here's what I can tell you:</p>
            </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>In 2018, Mozilla reported that internet data centres alone produced <strong>roughly the same carbon emissions as <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-internet-uses-more-electricity-than/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the airline industry<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a></strong> - about 2% of total emissions.</p>
        <p>This number doesn't factor in all the other devices that form the client end of the web - phones, laptops, personal computers, TVs, watches, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/brita-infinity-wi-fi-connected-pitcher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">water pitchers<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, <a href="https://www.lavviebot.com/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">litterboxes<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/kerastase-hair-coach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hairbrushes<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, et al.</p>
            </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>At the beginning of 2019, French green energy think tank The Shift Project estimated the total share of global emissions created by the internet to be <a href="https://theshiftproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lean-ICT-Report_The-Shift-Project_2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">3.7%<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> of the <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/co2-emissions-from-energy-combustion-and-industrial-processes-1900-2021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">36.1 billion metric tons<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> emitted globally, but that number still doesn't capture the seismic changes in the world over the past three years.</p>
            </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>Carbon emissions dipped in 2020, only to rebound in 2021, while work-from-home, streaming and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">web3<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> technologies only increased the internet's energy consumption. But by how much?</p>
        <p>To answer those questions, let's look at some of the big movers in bandwidth over the past two years.</p>

        <h2>The biggest factors in the internet&#39;s carbon emissions</h2>
        <h3>Streaming video</h3>
        <p>Actually some good news here: I had assumed that streaming media would be really gnarly for the environment, having read some scary articles a few years back. Turns out, <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-carbon-footprint-of-streaming-video-fact-checking-the-headlines#:~:text=Calculate%20your%20emissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">watching one hour of Netflix on a big TV in 4K<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> has the same carbon footprint as boiling a kettle twice. Not too bad! And those numbers can be improved drastically by using a smaller device, and streaming in lower quality.</p>
        <p>In part, this is thanks to the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3226029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">impressive efficiency gains in data centres<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> that have been happening for the last decade.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <h3>Remote work</h3>
        <p>Remote work is still, as of this writing, the subject of a lot of unsettled questions.</p>
        <p>In America, the vast majority of people who worked remotely due to COVID-19 are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-remote-workers-declining-may-2022-rcna28499#20220512-work-remote" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">back in the workplace<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>. In Canada, "only one half (50%) of Canadians currently working from home envision themselves returning to the office with any regularity in 2022", according to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/only-half-of-Canadians-say-they-expect-to-return-to-office#:~:text=Toronto%2C%20ON%2C%20December%2026%2C,Ipsos%20poll%20conducted%20on%20behalf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">an Ipsos poll<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>
        <p>So what does that mean for carbon emissions? While the future of remote work is uncertain, we can definitely say the that working from home is <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8a84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">kinda good, maybe, sometimes, for the most part<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>. Turns out that, while reducing commutes is a good thing, </p>
