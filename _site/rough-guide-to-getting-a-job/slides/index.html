</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
    <p>Over the past decade, the demand for people who can code for the web has skyrocketed. Coding "boot camps" have sprung up, offering to teach you the latest skills in a matter of months, with a focus on what employers are looking for in the moment.</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
    <p>These boot camps have increased the signal-to-noise ratio for recruiters, making it harder to distinguish candidates with working knowledge from those who have only a superficial grasp on a concept.</p>
    <p>As a result, it has become somewhat harder to get your foot in the door, particularly for those just starting out, and especially in remote-only work.</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
    <p>Don't let this discourage you, though. The government (where I am, in Canada), has 'web developer' as a top-rated job prospect for the next ten years in the majority of provinces.</p>

        <h2><div class="small-title">Skills:</div>Choosing&nbsp;& Building a Skill&nbsp;Set</h2>
    </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>As I mentioned a moment ago, there are <a href="/web-life-cycle/">many different jobs involved</a> in building stuff on the web. Similarly, there are many different jobs that could fall under the umbrella of "web development", too! You could be focussed on databases, or user interface design; you could specialize in data security, or performance, or architecting <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s. Regardless of where you end up, <span data-annotate>you have to start somewhere</span>.</p>
        <p>That "somewhere" is the internet - how it works (loosely), and a few relatively simple languages that make up the core web technologies.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>For the record, I'm not going to teach you this stuff today.</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>In fact, a lot of this stuff, I will <em>never</em> attempt to teach you, for the simple reason that <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline" data-ann-color="var(--warning)">the web is absolutely stuffed with free learn-to-code resources</span>. I'm never going to waste your time (or mine!) explaining something if I know that you can learn it elsewhere, as well or better, for free - I'm just going to point you in the right direction!</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>Of the free resources that are available, some are great, most are mediocre, and a lot are absolutely lousy. What few of them do is provide <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">context and guidance</span>. This, along with <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">networking</span> and <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">personalized feedback</span>, is essentially the value proposition of all web development classes (whether at a bootcamp or a college or wherever).</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>The web is built using technologies that are extensively documented and free to use, which means that <span data-annotate>everything you need to learn is public knowledge.</span> Knowing how it all fits together is the hard part.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, I'd like to share with you a couple of wonderful resources that map out exactly <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">where you can start</span>, <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">how to progress</span>, and, later on, where you might <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">branch off into a specialization</span> (once you're ready).</p>

</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>Roadmap.sh has paths for many different types of developers, not just web developers. It divides web development paths into "frontend" and "backend".</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>While I'd argue that this isn't as important a distinction as it used to be, it very roughly boils down to:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Frontend developer</dt>
            <dd>A frontend developer is responsible for things that happen <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">in the browser</span> - a website or web app's styles and links and buttons and content.</dd>
            <dt>Backend developer</dt>
            <dd>A backend developer is responsible for things that happen on the other end - the website's files waiting to be requested, data stored in databases that gets retrieved or updated by the website, and stays in memory after you leave.</dd>
        </dl>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>This is a painfully broad description of these two roles, and ignores the fact that these two roles have a ton of overlap, and can include or exclude some of these responsibilities, depending on the organization. If it's a smaller organization, they might just have one "fullstack" developer responsible for everything.</p>
        <p>This is just to say that I think you should take Roadmap.sh's taxonomy with a grain of salt, but don't let that take away from the enormous amount of value it provides.</p>

        <h3>A simpler roadmap from Flavio Copes</h3>
        <p>Roadmap.sh can seem like a lot - each node is a deep rabbit hole that you could spend endless time exploring, and nobody is there to tell you, "that's enough learning for now, time to move on".</p>
        <p>That's why I'd like to also show you <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/roadmap-web-developer-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a much simpler roadmap<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> that, rather than being the output of countless developers by consensus, is the opinion of some guy.

</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>Copes' roadmap starts where every web career journey starts, with the big 3: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. He then shares his opinions about a backend language for the server, a database, and a framework to help handle the data, state and composition of your site or application.</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>I don't share all of his opinions, but I respect the heck out of his experience, teaching and writing. My recommendation: <span data-annotate>check 'em both out</span>, figure out what resources are best <em>for you</em> to learn the basics of HTML, CSS & JavaScript, and go from there!</p>

        <p>The Odin Project is free, open-sourced (based on the input of hundreds of independent contributors), and has a sterling reputation.

        <p class="callout alert">I strongly recommend learning <em>something</em> about these "web fundamentals" <strong>before</strong> you start any formal (i.e. paid) learning, be it a college program, a bootcamp, or a paid course. You will get a lot more value if you are not starting with nothing. A lot of free resources available for these fundamentals are really, really good!</p>

    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>Python is the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">5<sup>th</sup> most popular language<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> among professional developers, behind only HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the database language SQL. It's tremendously popular for being easy to learn, and is used for AI and Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and to run the back end of websites. While JavaScript can famously do all the things (working on the server, interacting with your database, and creating interactivity on your website), many people find Python a better place to start when it comes to serious programming.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, a program at a traditional college or university is a big commitment. You're probably going to have to quit your job, and just be a student for a year (or several).

        <p>Which brings us to a contentious question: <span data-annotate>do bootcamps deliver?</span></p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>I feel confident in saying that this question, over which so much digital ink has been spilled, has a boring answer: <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--emphasis)">some do, for some people.</span></p>

<div data-slide class="row">
        <h3>Before you Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>I can strongly recommend, before you even consider bootcamps, <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">invest several weeks' worth of free time in teaching yourself the basics</span>. As mentioned earlier, there are a lot of great free resources to get you started. That way you'll know if you can <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">learn to love the work</span>. It would suck if you put down thousands of dollars only to quickly discover that you hate everything about the job. And if you <em>do</em> end up pursuing a bootcamp (or any other paid program), you'll get more value out of it than if you are scrambling to figure out the basics.</p> 
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <h3>Return on (a significant) investment</h3>
        <p>We've already established that you'll never learn everything you need to know from a single source, so the question is not "do bootcamps teach you everything?", but rather "do bootcamps make you money?". Full-time bootcamps cost, on average, <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4811078/coding-bootcamp-canada/#:~:text=Full%2Dtime%20programs%20cost%20around%20%2412%2C000%2C%20according%20to%20data%20viewed%20by%20Global%20News%2C%20while%20prices%20for%20part%2Dtime%20classes%20range%20from%20a%20few%20hundred%20to%20a%20few%20thousand%20dollars." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">about $12,000 in Canada<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, promising that you'll increase your salary by a significant amount, thus justifying the expense.</p>

            <h4>Accurate numbers about coding bootcamps are hard to come by</h4>

        <p>Keep in mind, this is a sampling of some comments from discussions on Hacker News, but bootcamps may try to sell you on the idea that they are producing graduates that are seen as somehow "elite". Not everyone shares this view.</p>
        <p>If you think a coding bootcamp might be for you, go into it with clear eyes. Understand that <span data-annotate>not all bootcamps are created equal</span>, that you'll need to <span data-annotate>verify their claims</span> for yourself, and that successfully completing one is <span data-annotate>not a golden ticket.</span></p>

        <div class="callout warning">Time for some <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--alert)">disclosure:</span> I started my coding career by taking a 12-month post-graduate college course in Web Development at Humber College, and, seven years later, I started teaching classes there, too, as a part-time instructor.

<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>I think it's a pretty common knowledge that you should research a college or university, as well as the particular program you're applying to, before you try to get in, so I won't belabour that point. I'm also, as noted, not in a position to give you unbiased advice about learning to code at college.</p>
        <p>I will simply say that it was a somewhat miserable experience that I don't regret at all.</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>One distinction I do want to make is the difference between learning about Computer Science ('CS' or 'CompSci'), and learning to be a coder.</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <h4>Computer science vs. web development</h4>
        <p>Essentially this is the difference between learning to be a biologist and learning to be a farmer. <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--emphasis)">Both are super interesting!</span> Being a certified biologist means (at least) a four-year degree, and focusses on theory. And while you definitely go to school to learn how to farm (shout out to the <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/oac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">aggies<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>), it's a set of practical skills that requires a lot of hands-on learning.</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>If you want a career in web development, a computer science degree can help, but it's not required, and the focus on abstract concepts might come at the expense of time you could've spent on the practical skills that will become your stock-in-trade.</p>

<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>A lot of big organizations offer certifications on their proprietary technologies. Could these certifications be a shortcut to a better job?</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>I'm gonna say: <span data-annotate>not if you're just starting out.</span> Even once you're strong in the fundamentals, some certifications are much more highly regarded than others. As a rule of thumb, based on my conversations with people in hiring positions, certifications for basic competencies aren't well-regarded. The tests can usually be passed with basic memorization, and don't impress nearly as much as <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--emphasis)">actually doing stuff.</span> Basic skills in web development are pretty much entirely <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">things you can showcase by building stuff yourself.</span> Ideally you have professional experience, but if not, you can still try things out in a personal project, demonstrating a practical understanding, rather than simply being good with memorizing stuff off flash cards.</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>People <em>do</em> appreciate certifications for skills that are less practical as weekend projects, for example <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/?ch=tile&tile=getstarted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Amazon Web Services' Professional certifications<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/certification#why-get-google-cloud-certified:~:text=Cloud%20Engineer-,Professional%20certification,-Assess%20key%20technical" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Cloud Professional certifications<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, and other certs for large-scale applications that are hard to replicate at home.</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p><abbr title="Information Security">Infosec</abbr> tends to be more certification-driven than other web roles, because there tends to be more risk (and insurance) involved in those roles. Personally, I've been hoping to get certified as a <a href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/wascertification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Web Accessibility Professional<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, to supplement my years of practical experience, but only because accessibility can be an issue of legal compliance, and having a professional organization sign off on me would help me breathe easier!</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>These professional and specialty certifications tend to be expensive, so my advice is to get a job where they aren't mandatory, and ask if they have a training budget. If they do, see if you can get certified without having to foot the (significant) bill yourself!</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">
        <p>Long story short: beginner/general certifications are only as valuable as <span data-annotate>the learning you get from studying</span> for them.</p>
