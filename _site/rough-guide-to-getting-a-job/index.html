    <p>If you <em>do</em> want to write code for a living, however, let me congratulate you on a good career choice.</p>
    <p>There's good reason to believe that a coding career is <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/recession-proof-industries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">recession-proof<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29808376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">future-proof<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, and a pretty good job to have when <a href="https://medium.com/coderbyte/how-the-covid-19-pandemic-is-impacting-software-development-hiring-72243f41ac9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">everyone suddenly needs to work at home for a few years.<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a></p>

<div data-slide class="row">
    <p>Over the past decade, the demand for people who can code for the web has skyrocketed. Coding "boot camps" have sprung up, offering to teach you the latest skills in a matter of months, with a focus on what employers are looking for in the moment.</p>
    <p>These boot camps have increased the signal-to-noise ratio for recruiters, making it harder to distinguish candidates with working knowledge from those who have only a superficial grasp on a concept.</p>
    <p>As a result, it has become somewhat harder to get your foot in the door, particularly for those just starting out, and especially in remote-only work.</p>
</div>
<div data-slide class="row">

        <p>As I mentioned a moment ago, there are <a href="/web-life-cycle/">many different jobs involved</a> in building stuff on the web. Similarly, there are many different jobs that could fall under the umbrella of "web development", too! You could be focussed on databases, or user interface design; you could specialize in data security, or performance, or architecting <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s. Regardless of where you end up, <span data-annotate>you have to start somewhere</span>.</p>
        <p>That "somewhere" is the internet - how it works (loosely), and a few relatively simple languages that make up the core web technologies.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-slide class="row">
        <p>For the record, I'm not going to teach you this stuff today.</p>
        <p>In fact, a lot of this stuff, I will <em>never</em> attempt to teach you, for the simple reason that <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline" data-ann-color="var(--warning)">the web is absolutely stuffed with free learn-to-code resources</span>. I'm never going to waste your time (or mine!) explaining something if I know that you can learn it elsewhere, as well or better, for free - I'm just going to point you in the right direction!</p>
        <p>Of the free resources that are available, some are great, most are mediocre, and a lot are absolutely lousy. What few of them do is provide <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">context and guidance</span>. This, along with <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">networking</span> and <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">personalized feedback</span>, is essentially the value proposition of all web development classes (whether at a bootcamp or a college or wherever).</p>
        <p>The web built using technologies that are extensively documented and free to use, which means that everything you need to learn is public knowledge. Knowing how it all fits together is the hard part.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, I'd like to share with you a couple of wonderful resources that map out exactly where you can start, how to progress, and, later on, where you might branch off into a specialization (once you're ready).</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Roadmap.sh has paths for many different types of developers, not just web developers. It divides web development paths into "frontend" and "backend".</p>
        <p>While I'd argue that this isn't as important a distinction as it used to be, it very roughly boils down to:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Frontend developer</dt>
            <dd>A frontend developer is responsible for things that happen <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">in the browser</span> - a website or web app's styles and links and buttons and content.</dd>
            <dt>Backend developer</dt>
            <dd>A backend developer is responsible for things that happen on the other end - the website waiting for users to retrieve it, data stored in databases that gets retrieved or updated by the website, and stays in memory after you leave.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>This is a painfully broad description of these two roles, and ignores the fact that these two roles have a ton of overlap, and can include or exclude some of these responsibilities, depending on the organization. If it's a smaller organization, they might just have one "fullstack" developer responsible for everything.</p>
        <p>This is just to say that I think you should take Roadmap.sh's taxonomy with a grain of salt, but don't let that take away from the enormous amount of value it provides.</p>

        <h3>A simpler roadmap from Flavio Copes</h3>
        <p>Roadmap.sh can seem like a lot - each node is a deep rabbit hole that you could spend endless time exploring, and nobody is there to tell you, "that's enough learning for now, time to move on".</p>
        <p>That's why I'd like to also show you <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/roadmap-web-developer-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a much simpler roadmap<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> that, rather than being the output of countless developers by consensus, is the opinion of some guy. Luckily, it's a very smart, thoughtful, and experienced guy who helps tons of people with their web careers - Italian computer engineer <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Flavio Copes<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>
        <p>Copes' roadmap starts where every web career journey starts, with the big 3: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. He then shares his opinions about a backend language for the server, a database, and a framework to help handle the data, state and composition of your site or application.</p>
        <p>I don't share all of his opinions, but I respect the heck out of his experience, teaching and writing. My recommendation: <span data-annotate>check 'em both out</span>, figure out what resources are best <em>for you</em> to learn the basics of HTML, CSS & JavaScript, and go from there!</p>

        <p>A slim majority went to a traditional college or university, about 40% took an online course, and 10% went to a bootcamp.</p>
        <p>The most popular way to learn, though, is by watching Youtube videos and reading blog posts and online documentation.</p>

    <h4>Paid Resources I Recommend</h4>
    <p>Because of the wealth of free, open sources for learning fundamentals, I'm hesitant to recommend any paid resources for introductory materials. That being said, there are two creators I'd like to call out, because they create resources that are...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>incredibly fun, creative and approachable,</li>
        <li>meticulous, and</li>
        <li>offer a mix of free and paid content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm <strong>not</strong> recommending them because they're both Canadian. (But do I enjoy that fact? Yes, yes I do.)</p>

        <h2><div class="small-title">Credentials:</div>To&nbsp;Bootcamp or not to&nbsp;Bootcamp?</h2>
        <p><span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--alert)">Learning by yourself is hard.</span> It takes a ton of discipline, and if something doesn't work, it can be really frustrating to figure out <em>what went wrong</em>.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, a program at a traditional college or university is a big commitment. You're probably going to have to quit your job, and just be a student for a year (or several). If you have a specific job title in mind, some of the topics that get covered might not feel relevant to your goals.</p>
        <p>If only there was somewhere you could go to learn exactly what the job postings are asking for, in less time than a traditional institution.</p>
        <p>Guess what? That's exactly what coding bootcamps (promise to) do!</p>
        <p>Which brings us to a contentious question: <span data-annotate>do bootcamps deliver?</span></p>
        <p>I feel confident in saying that this question, over which so much digital ink has been spilled, has a boring answer: <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--emphasis)">some do, for some people.</span></p>
        <h3>Before you Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>I can strongly recommend, before you even consider bootcamps, <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">invest several weeks' worth of free time in teaching yourself the basics</span>. As mentioned earlier, there are a lot of great free resources to get you started. That way you'll know if you can <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">learn to love the work</span>. It would suck if you put down thousands of dollars only to quickly discover that you hate everything about the job. And if you <em>do</em> end up pursuing a bootcamp (or any other paid program), you'll get more value out of it than if you are scrambling to figure out the basics.</p> 
        <h3>Return on (a significant) investment</h3>
        <p>We've already established that you'll never learn everything you need to know from a single source, so the question is not "do bootcamps teach you everything?", but rather "do bootcamps make you money?". Full-time bootcamps cost, on average, <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4811078/coding-bootcamp-canada/#:~:text=Full%2Dtime%20programs%20cost%20around%20%2412%2C000%2C%20according%20to%20data%20viewed%20by%20Global%20News%2C%20while%20prices%20for%20part%2Dtime%20classes%20range%20from%20a%20few%20hundred%20to%20a%20few%20thousand%20dollars." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">about $12,000 in Canada<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, promising that you'll increase your salary by a significant amount, thus justifying the expense.</p>
        <p>It's at this point that it's important we talk about a big caveat:</p>
        <div class="callout alert">
            <h4>Accurate numbers about coding bootcamps are hard to come by</h4>
            <p>Bootcamps, with few exceptions, are unaccredited and operate with little to no oversight. Nearly all don't qualify you for student loans. Some are "partnered" with traditional institutions, while others are entirely independent, without even the reputation of a larger institution to back them up.</p>
            <p>This has lead to a reputation for <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">bogus<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/fulligin/status/1452658647994015748?s=20&t=f9GbrnhHhQmZWQU9ljVmQw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">claims<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lzsthw/status/1212284566431576069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">shady business practices<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>. (Seriously, if you are thinking of attending a bootcamp, actively seek out anti-bootcamp opinions and consider them.)</p>
            <p><span data-annotate>Reliable hard data about outcomes for bootcamp attendees simply does not exist for the industry as a whole.</span></p>
            <p>Additionally, when researching a bootcamp, take anything you read with a grain of salt. Remember that the internet is the main marketing channel for these organizations, and expect them to be very good at optimizing search results. Their value proposition could be (somewhat cynically) described as optimizing résumés to get the desired results from the <a href="https://careers.workopolis.com/advice/beat-automated-resume-screening/#:~:text=More%C2%A0than%2060%25%20of%20companies%20use%20some%20sort%20of%20automated%20screening%20(you%20might%20have%20heard%20of%20this%20referred%20to%20as%20an%20applicant%20tracking%20system)%20to%20streamline%20their%20hiring%20process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">disturbingly popular<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> automated "resume parsers" (a.k.a. <abbr title="Applicant Tracking System">ATS</abbr>'s). So naturally, these businesses would take SEO seriously (and be good at it, too).</p>
            <p>Also - just between you and me - a lot of the comments I read on reddit or hacker news that endorse the bootcamp experience can read a little... fishy. At very least, personal anecdotes of success are just that: anecdotes.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Bootcamps will promise the moon, but with so many to choose from, so little oversight, and not being sure what to trust when you Google them, how can you choose?</p>
        <p>For that, I'm going to steal some of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/aswinpranam/2020/02/22/the-case-against-ai-ux-and-coding-bootcamps/?sh=4fb1894e4bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Forbes' advice<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>Perform a LinkedIn search of previous students and inquire about their experience in the program. </li>
                <li>[E]xplore available scholarships (including those) for underrepresented communities. </li>
                <li>Understand the bootcamp learning plan (e.g., projects-only, formal curriculum, apprenticeship).</li>
                <li>Ensure that bootcamps that use ISAs (income share agreements) have a capped maximum so overpayment risk is avoided.</li>
                <li>Investigate the financial health of the bootcamp to prevent unexpected closures or resource cuts. </li>
                <li>Talk to HR managers at target companies and ask for their candid opinions about bootcamp hires. </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Follow these tips to compare the promises of the bootcamp to see if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can save some money.</li>
            <li>The learning plans aligns with your goals. (Aren't you glad you learned a bit on your own so you can understand some of the jargon?)</li>
            <li>You can avoid sketchy financing/lending practices. (If you aren't sure what an "Income Sharing Agreement" (ISA) is, or even if you think you are, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/senator-warren-reps-pressley-and-porter-investigate-reports-that-education-department-seeks-to-develop-income-share-agreements-in-risky-new-student-debt-experiments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">be wary of them<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>).</li>
            <li>You can see if attending a bootcamp isn't actually shooting yourself in the foot.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Some hiring managers hate bootcamps</h4>
        <p>To that last point, be warned that there are people in hiring positions who have stopped hiring recent bootcamp grads altogether.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22301802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">"Of 20 people I've interviewed who completed a coding bootcamp without prior CS education in the past year or so, I think 1 passed the phone screen. At this point I outright reject them because of the futility."<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a></p>
            <hr>
            <p>"<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31695850#:~:text=For%20everyone%20reading,the%20underlying%20concepts." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">For everyone reading, being on the hiring side I would advise against bootcamps. We pretty much stopped recruiting from those because the signal to noise ratio was just too low. It seems a lot of bootcamps teach with rote, rather than by looking at the underlying concepts.<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>"</p>
            <hr>
            <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22303319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">"I am not going to hire anybody from a ...coding bootcamp. Seems like they turn out people who know how to hack things together based on shallow knowledge."<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Keep in mind, this is a sampling of some comments from discussions on Hacker News, but bootcamps may try to sell you on the idea that they are producing graduates that are seen as somehow "elite". Not everyone shares this view.</p>
        <p>If you think a coding bootcamp might be for you, go into it with clear eyes. Understand that <span data-annotate>not all bootcamps are created equal</span>, that you'll need to <span data-annotate>verify their claims</span> for yourself, and that successfully completing one is <span data-annotate>not a golden ticket.</span></p>

        <p>Okay, so maybe you're someone who wants a more immersive experience than a bootcamp, and you'd feel better about giving thousands of dollars to an institution with more oversight.</p>
        <p><span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--emphasis)">🎓 Welcome to college! 🎓</span></p>
        <div class="callout warning">Time for some <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--alert)">disclosure:</span> I started my coding career by taking a 12-month post-graduate college course in Web Development at Humber College, and, seven years later, I started teaching classes there, too, as a part-time instructor. As of this writing, I still do.</div>
        <p>I think it's a pretty common knowledge that you should research a college or university, as well as the particular program you're applying to, before you try to get in, so I won't belabour that point. I'm also, as noted, not in a position to give you unbiased advice about learning to code at college.</p>
        <p>I will simply say that it was a somewhat miserable experience that I don't regret at all.</p>
        <p>One distinction I do want to make is the difference between learning about Computer Science ('CS' or 'CompSci'), and learning to be a coder.</p>
        <h4>Computer science vs. web development</h4>
        <p>Essentially this is the difference between learning to be a biologist and learning to be a farmer. <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--emphasis)">Both are super interesting!</span> Being a certified biologist means (at least) a four-year degree, and focusses on theory. And while you definitely go to school to learn how to farm (shout out to the <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/oac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">aggies<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>), it's a set of practical skills that requires a lot of hands-on learning.</p>
        <p>If you want a career in web development, a computer science degree can help, but it's not required, and the focus on abstract concepts might come at the expense of time you could've spent on the practical skills that will become your stock-in-trade.</p>
        <p>It seems that <a href="https://www.ontariocolleges.ca/en/programs/computers-and-telecommunications/web-design-development?q=development&page=0&by%5BProgramLengthGroupEnglish%5D%5B0%5D=Two%20years&by%5BProgramLengthGroupEnglish%5D%5B1%5D=One%20year%20or%20less" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">basically all<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> colleges where I am (Ontario, Canada) offer a one- or two-year program in web development.

        <h2><div class="small-title">Credentials:</div>Other&nbsp;Certifications</h2>
        <p>A lot of big organizations offer certifications on their proprietary technologies. Could these certifications be a shortcut to a better job?</p>
        <p>I'm gonna say: <span data-annotate>not if you're just starting out.</span> Even once you're strong in the fundamentals, some certifications are much more highly regarded than others. As a rule of thumb, based on my conversations with people in hiring positions, certifications for basic competencies aren't well-regarded. The tests can usually be passed with basic memorization, and don't impress nearly as much as <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--emphasis)">actually doing stuff.</span> Basic skills in web development are pretty much entirely <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">things you can showcase by building stuff yourself.</span> Ideally you have professional experience, but if not, you can still try things out in a personal project, demonstrating a practical understanding, rather than simply being good with memorizing stuff off flash cards.</p>
        <p>People <em>do</em> appreciate certifications for skills that are less practical as weekend projects, for example <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/?ch=tile&tile=getstarted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Amazon Web Services' Professional certifications<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/certification#why-get-google-cloud-certified:~:text=Cloud%20Engineer-,Professional%20certification,-Assess%20key%20technical" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Cloud Professional certifications<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, and other certs for large-scale applications that are hard to replicate at home.</p>
        <p><abbr title="Information Security">Infosec</abbr> tends to be more certification-driven than other web roles, because there tends to be more risk (and insurance) involved in those roles. Personally, I've been hoping to get certified as a <a href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/wascertification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Web Accessibility Professional<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, to supplement my years of practical experience, but only because accessibility can be an issue of legal compliance, and having a professional organization sign off on me would help me breathe easier!</p>
        <p>These professional and specialty certifications tend to be expensive, so my advice is to get a job where they aren't mandatory, and ask if they have a training budget. If they do, see if you can get certified without having to foot the (significant) bill yourself!</p>
        <p>Long story short: beginner/general certifications are only as valuable as <span data-annotate>the learning you get from studying</span> for them.</p>
