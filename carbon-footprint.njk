        <p>In 2018, Mozilla reported that internet data centres alone produced <strong>roughly the same carbon emissions as {% ext "https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-internet-uses-more-electricity-than/" %}the airline industry{% endext %}</strong> - about 2% of total emissions.</p>
        <p>This number doesn't factor in all the other devices that form the client end of the web - phones, laptops, personal computers, TVs, watches, {% ext "https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/brita-infinity-wi-fi-connected-pitcher" %}water pitchers{% endext %}, {% ext "https://www.lavviebot.com/en/home.html" %}litter boxes{% endext %}, {% ext "https://www.allure.com/story/kerastase-hair-coach" %}hairbrushes{% endext %}, et al.</p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>At the beginning of 2019, French "post-carbon economy think tank" The Shift Project estimated the total share of global emissions created by the internet to be {% ext "https://theshiftproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lean-ICT-Report_The-Shift-Project_2019.pdf" %}3.7%{% endext %} of the {% ext "https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/co2-emissions-from-energy-combustion-and-industrial-processes-1900-2021" %}36.1 billion metric tons{% endext %} emitted globally, (for a total of about 1.3 billion tons), but that number still doesn't capture the <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">seismic changes</span> in the world over the past three years.</p>

        <h4>Remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic.</h4>
        <p>While 2020 was a {% ext "https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/annual-change-in-co2-emissions-from-energy-combustion-and-industrial-processes-1900-2021" %}great year for carbon emission reduction{% endext %}, with a global reduction of 1.86 gigatonnes from 2019, we bounced back in 2021 in the worst possible way.</p>
        <p>I heard murmurs that this was because so many of us were working from home, but that might not be the case.</p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>Throughout the 20th, and into the 21st century, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions were strongly correlated with <abbr title="gross domestic product">GDP</abbr>.</p>
        <figure>
            {% image "images/co2-emissions-vs-gdp.png", "Graph showing a strong correlation between a country's gross domestic produce and their carbon emissions", "(min-width: 30em) 600px, 100vw", "Our World in Data based on the Global Carbon Project, Maddison Project Database 2020 (Bolt and van Zanden, 2020)" %}

        </figure>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>One of the promising indicators for, you know, human survival is that we are making progress in decoupling those numbers:</p>
        <figure>
            {% image "images/co2-gdp.png", "Graph showing a reduction in kilograms of carbon emitted as a factor of global gross domestic product", "(min-width: 30em) 600px, 100vw", "The World Bank" %}

        </figure>
        <p>However, the rebound in carbon emissions from 2019 to 2020 suggests that CO<sup>2</sup> emissions are less about <em>where</em> people work, and more about <em>whether</em> they work.</p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>That said, where <em>are</em> people going to be working in the years to come?</p>
        <p>In America, the vast majority of people who worked remotely due to COVID-19 are {% ext "https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-remote-workers-declining-may-2022-rcna28499#20220512-work-remote" %}back in the workplace{% endext %}. In Canada, "only one half (50%) of Canadians currently working from home envision themselves returning to the office with any regularity in 2022", according to {% ext "https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/only-half-of-Canadians-say-they-expect-to-return-to-office#:~:text=Toronto%2C%20ON%2C%20December%2026%2C,Ipsos%20poll%20conducted%20on%20behalf" %}an Ipsos poll{% endext %}.</p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>So what does that mean for carbon emissions? While the future of remote work is uncertain, we can definitely say the that working from home is (according to a meta-analysis published in the journal <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>) {% ext "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8a84" %}kinda good, maybe, sometimes, for the most part{% endext %}.</p>
        <p>Turns out that, while reducing commuting is good for the planet, those gains can be partially (or even wholly) offset by other secondary effects like buying new, {% ext "https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/research/publications/rare-earth-elements-a-resource-constraint-of-the-energy-transition/" %}rare earth element intensive{% endext %} home office equipment and home energy use, and an increase in non-work-related travel. The benefits of reduced commutes are smallest in places where there's good public transit, where the {% ext "https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/36-28-0001/2021004/article/00005-eng.htm#:~:text=61.5-,Toronto,55.7,-Hamilton" %}reduced ridership{% endext %} can {% ext "https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/transit-in-toronto/transit-funding/#:~:text=The%20TTC%20is%20the%20least%20subsidized%20system%20in%20North%20America." %}negatively impact{% endext %} lower-emission transportation.</p>
        <p>In short, this is a hard topic upon which to draw any firm conclusions, particularly, the authors of the meta-analysis note, as <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">work itself becomes harder to pin down</span>. The shift to the "gig economy", contract work, and the expectation in the modern workplace of 24/7 availability - a deliberate blurring of the lines between working and doing literally anything else - makes it hard to determine when someone's carbon emissions are work-related.</p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>To summarize: it's a <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--emphasis)">very good thing when people don't drive to work</span>, but those benefits are only as good as the sustainability of <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--alert)">our home office equipment, public transit and electrical grid</span>.</p>

    {% slide %}
        <h3>Web3: Blockchain, Crypto and NFTs</h3>
        <p>Finally, <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--alert)">a true villain</span>.</p>
        <p>{% ext "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3" %}"Web3"{% endext %} is a somewhat vague buzzword for blockchain-basedâ€¦ stuff. Blockchain is a {% ext "https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain" %}technology that allows for the decentralized verification of ownership and transaction histories{% endext %}. In other words, everybody gets a copy of a document that shows who owns what and where they got it. This is the technology that underlies most cryptocurrencies ("crypto") and non-fungible tokens ("NFTs"). While web3 is hazy and a bit speculative at the moment, we <em>do</em> have some understanding of NFTs and crypto.</p>
        {% image "images/Bitcoin_and_Blockchain.jpeg", "Abstrakte Bitcoin Kunst - artwork by Denis Hess", "(min-width: 30em) 600px, 100vw", "Denis Hess, CC BY-SA 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0>, via Wikimedia Commons" %}
        <h4>Crypto's environmental footprint</h4>
        <p class="callout warning">Full disclosure: I may not know what I'm talking about here. This is a complex topic, so please understand that this is an amateur's best effort at understanding some complicated stuff, and take my words with a grain of salt. I promise I'll update this section if I understand this better in the future.</p>
        <p>Okay, so, best as I can tell - the integrity of a cryptocurrency's blockchain relies on a process called "Proof of Work", wherein there is a bit of a lottery. The reward is crypto, but you get more lottery tickets based on how much computational power you expend. Do I fully understand <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline" data-ann-color="var(--alert)">how maxing GPUs, solving arbitrary, {% ext "https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=" %}progressively harder{% endext %} computational problems for Bitcoin, {% ext "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp#toc-proof-of-work-faqs" %}somehow verifies transactions{% endext %} (or {% ext "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work" %}prevents spam email{% endext %} for that matter)?</span> Nope. However, the expenditure of computational resources results in the verification of transactions (somehow), and miners receive a fee for transactions they verify (I'm reasonably certain).</p>
        <p>What I <em>do</em> know is that <span data-annotate>running a competition to see who can push the most computers harder and harder over time has not been great for carbon emissions.</span> Researchers estimate that Bitcoin mining (not including all other cryptocurrencies) in 2021 alone was responsible for about {% ext "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358861058_Revisiting_Bitcoin%27s_carbon_footprint" %}65.4 million tonnes of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions{% endext %} - roughly the same as the {% ext "https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/carbon-footprint-by-country#dataTable" %}entire country of Austria{% endext %}. (However, let's keep it in context - 65.4 million is still only 4.9% of 1.3 billion.)</p>
        <p>Another verification method, called Proof of Stake ("PoS"), basically requires you to put up crypto you already own as collateral for the accuracy of your version of the verification ledger. Proof of stake is <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">less energy intensive, but hasn't been widely adopted</span> among cryptocurrencies (although Ethereum, the next largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, is {% ext "https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/" %}planning to switch over to PoS{% endext %}).</p>
        <p>Ethereum is an important part of the NFT market. The Ethereum blockchain enabled "smart contracts" in 2017, which lead to the NFT market of today. These smart contracts aren't necessarily contracts in the traditional sense, but the execution of a computer function on the blockchain itself, meaning that you can trade something more complex than a "coin" (a coin being, in essence, a series of alphanumeric characters).  This opened the door to trading non-fungible tokens. NFTs are digital goods, whichâ€¦ well, they're also a series of alphanumeric characters, but when an NFT is traded, you're executing a smart contract where the {% ext "https://theconversation.com/how-nonfungible-tokens-work-and-where-they-get-their-value-a-cryptocurrency-expert-explains-nfts-157489" %}digital signature of the file{% endext %} (rather than the entirety of the code) is authenticated. I'm pretty sure.</p>
        <p><span data-annotate>How much carbon does Ethereum currently produce?</span> Probably about {% ext "https://kylemcdonald.github.io/ethereum-emissions/" %}7.9 million tonnes per year{% endext %} - a fraction of Bitcoin's carbon footprint, but a lot more than nothing (and, hopefully, about 1000 times as much as it <em>will</em> produce after the {% ext "https://fortune.com/2021/05/27/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-proof-of-stake-environment-carbon/" %}long-awaited{% endext %} switch to Proof-of-Stake).</p>
        <p><span data-annotate>What percentage of that is due to NFTs?</span> This is not something I could find a lot of sources on. ARTnews {% ext "https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/nft-carbon-environmental-impact-1234589742/#:~:text=represent%20a%20very%20small%20portion%20of%20Ethereum%20transactions%20overall" %}cites estimates ranging from 1%-2.5%{% endext %} of Ethereum transactions being NFT exchanges (the vast majority of the remaining percentage being trades of Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether, a.k.a. ETH).</p>
        <p>But here's where we draw what some people claim as an important distinction - mining vs. transactions. Mining, i.e. the <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--alert)" data-ann-type="underline">computationally expensive proof-of-work</span>, is the #1 source of crypto's carbon emissions by orders of magnitude. The transactions themselves create a fairly negligible amount of emissions. The mining creates the <em>capacity</em> for the transactions, and the number of transactions doesn't directly affect the size of crypto's carbon footprint.</p>
        <p>That being said, the transactions result in fees paid to the miners, who are incentivised to build out the capacity of the network through Proof of Work. Essentially, this capacity is what results in the massive carbon footprint of blockchain technologies. The reason it's tough to come up with a number to represent the carbon emissions per NFT is that the carbon emissions will still happen without the transactions, but the reason for the carbon emissions is because the transactions incentivise the capacity building.</p>

            If youâ€™re on the plane, youâ€™re obviously responsible for a portion of its emissions.

        <p>Okay, to recap:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There's good reasons to <strong>not give up</strong> on the good ol' planet earth.</li>
            <li>It's good to make some personal changes, but <strong>some choices matter way more</strong> than others.</li>
            <li>It's most important to <strong>push for systemic changes</strong>.</li>
            <li>Watching TV is okay, or making tea is not, depending on how you look at it.</li>
            <li>Working from home won't save the world.</li>
            <li>Improving <strong>energy efficiency of big consumers</strong> (like internet data centres) has a massive impact on carbon emissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Bitcoin is really, really bad</strong> for the environment, and probably won't get better any time soon. But it still only accounts for less than 5% of the internet's total carbon emissions.</li>
            <li>NFTs aren't <em>great</em>, but they're a tiny fraction of the crypto world, and are likely to be less energy intensive in the near future.</li>
            <li>"Web3" is vague and kinda sketchy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span data-annotate>So what do we do with this?</span></p>
        <p>Well, I'm not going to make any grand pronouncements, but I will recommend a book: {% ext "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/books/review/the-wizard-and-the-prophet-charles-mann-william-vogt-norman-borlaug.html" %}The Wizard and the Prophet{% endext %} by Charles C. Mann.</p>
        <p>In it, he contrasts two environmental philosophers from the early- to mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, William Vogt and Norman Borlaug. Vogt was a radical conservationist, Borlaug an optimistic technologist. Mann doesn't offer any firm conclusions about who was correct - they were both right in some very important ways, and wrong in others. My takeaway is that you can't discount either perspective, as <span data-annotate>climate change needs to be addressed in a lot of ways all at once</span> - some of which mean <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">reducing our consumption</span> (of fossil fuels, or meat, for example), and some that mean <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">creating new capacities</span> (for carbon sequestration and renewable resources, to name two examples).</p>
        <p>Overall, I love {% ext "https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions" %}this list of ranked solutions{% endext %} from Project Drawdown.</p>

        <p>Okay, yeesh. Let's talk about <span data-annotate><em>systemic</em> changes that we can advocate for:</span></p>
        <h4>Changing the system</h4>
        <p>The most powerful tools we have in our toolbox are not {% ext "https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22585831/starbucks-bathroom-privatization-government" %}hoping that corporations will be nice to us{% endext %}, but <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline" data-ann-color="var(--warning)">{% ext "https://theconversation.com/the-paris-agreement-is-working-as-intended-but-weve-still-got-a-long-way-to-go-173478" %}publicly accountable regulatory bodies{% endext %} and {% ext "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/sep/20/labor-climate-allies-green-union-jobs" %}trade unions{% endext %}</span>. Regulation needs to be done with <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline" data-ann-color="var(--warning)">an eye to secondary effects</span> (for example, research published in the <em>Joule</em> journal suggests that China's ban on PoW Bitcoin mining perversely lead miners to turn to energy from {% ext "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358861058_Revisiting_Bitcoin%27s_carbon_footprint" %}less renewable resources{% endext %}).</p>
        <p>The internet's carbon emissions are, for the most part, <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline" data-ann-color="var(--warning)">no different</span> from carbon emissions produced by any other energy-hungry industry, and can reduced the same way - providing the industrialists with <span data-annotate>the "carrot" of {% ext "https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=334600ce2c84" %}cheap green energy technology{% endext %}</span> (which gets cheaper the more we invest in it), and <span data-annotate>the "stick" of {% ext "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421515300550?via%3Dihub" %}carbon taxes{% endext %}.</span></p>
        <p>Of course, we can hope that the big tech players stick to {% ext "https://clim8.com/blog/sustainable-investing/investing-in-big-tech-ranking-the-tech-giants-climate-commitments/" %}their pledges{% endext %}, but, as usual, {% ext "https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22925436/big-tech-climate-change-goals-weak-report" %}trust 'em{% endext %} as far as you can {% ext "https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/details/37035" %}throw 'em{% endext %}.</p>
        <p>If you're in a litigious mood (and who isn't from time to time?), you can {% ext "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_litigation" %}sue a polluter{% endext %}! The Paris Agreement is often the subject of people's disappointment, but it has been <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline" data-ann-color="var(--warning)">the foundation of numerous lawsuits</span> by citizens suing their governments in countries like the U.K., Turkey and France, and in 2021, the case of <em>Milieudefensie et al v Royal Dutch Shell</em> was heard at the Hague, where they handed down a landmark ruling in environmental law - the {% ext "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milieudefensie_et_al_v_Royal_Dutch_Shell" %}first major ruling{% endext %} against a corporation.</p>
        <h4>Changing a website</h4>
        <p>Are you working on the web? The more popular the website, the bigger an impact you could have!</p>
        <p>To level-set, the {% ext "https://www.websitecarbon.com/" %}Website Carbon Calculator{% endext %} gives us the following info:</p>
        <blockquote>The average web page tested produces approximately 0.5 grams CO<sup>2</sup> per page view. For a website with 10,000 monthly page views, that's 60 kg CO<sup>2</sup> per year.</blockquote>
        <p>This number is based on the "page weight" of the page visited.</p>
        <div class="callout emphasis">
            <h5>What is "page weight"?</h5>
            <p>Whenever you visit a page on the internet, you're asking for a remote computer (a "server") to send you all the files you need to see the page - an HTML file, and probably a bunch of images, and files containing the CSS and JavaScript code to style the page and provide interactions. The size of all those files combined is the "weight" of the page you're visiting.</p>
        </div>
        <p>I've had the opportunity to work on the homepages of some major corporations, and shaving just a small fraction of the page weight from a page that gets millions (or {% ext "https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-50-most-visited-websites-in-the-world/#:~:text=Top%20Three%20Websites%20(Monthly%20visits,Facebook%3A%2025.5%20billion" %}billions{% endext %}) of monthly visitors could save thousands of kilograms of emissions every year!</p>
        <h5>How do you reduce page weight?</h5>
        <p>That's a topic that I'm going to devote a whole lot of attention to on a separate occasion, but I can tell you this: <span data-annotate data-ann-type="underline">the low-hanging fruit is always images</span>. Use less images, and use images in a smarter way (with compression and modern image formats). <span data-annotate>Images are almost always the biggest part of a page's weight.</span></p>
        {% image "images/bytes-distribution-content-type.png", "Chart showing median content by asset type on the web in 2021. Images are by far the biggest contributor to page weight.", "(min-width: 30em) 600px, 100vw", "Chart via https://almanac.httparchive.org/" %}
        <div class="callout emphasis">
            <strong>Text is cheap</strong>
            <p>The average page weight is now {% ext "https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2021/page-weight" %}2.2MB{% endext %}.</p>
            <p>Here is the {% ext "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1400/1400-0.txt" %}<strong><em>entire text of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations</em></strong>{% endext %}. At 1MB, it's less than half the size!</p>
        </div>
        <p>Another recommendation I'll make, if you're working on a website for someone else: <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--emphasis)">tell them it will make them a bunch of money</span>.</p>
        <p>Seriously, the lower the page weight, the faster your pages load, and the faster your pages load, the more money you make. Don't take my word for it:</p>

        <h4>Understanding the carbon footprint of a website</h4>
        <p>You can get an estimate of any website's carbon emissions from the {% ext "https://www.websitecarbon.com/" %}Website Carbon Calculator{% endext %}.</p>
        <div class="callout">

        <p>If it's <em>your</em> website, you can always improve it - the Website Carbon Calculator recommends three actions:</p>

        </ul>

        <p>I'm going to end today with one of my favourite things on the internet: a <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--emphasis)">website that runs entirely off solar energy</span>.</p>
        <figure>
            {% image "images/low-tech.png", "", "(min-width: 30em) 600px, 100vw" %}
            <figcaption>The solar-powered homepage of {% ext "https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/" %}Low Tech Magazine{% endext %}</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Rather than running off a green hosting service, they deliver their website to the entire world using a single {% ext "https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html#server" %}tiny computer{% endext %} powered by a 20 watt solar panel connected to a small battery. The background of the website actually shows the battery level! When the battery is drained entirely, the website will go offline - but it's up 95% of the time ({% ext "https://www.notechmagazine.com/2021/04/solar-powered-website-uptime-for-2020.html" %}a little more in summer, a little less in winter{% endext %}).</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
        <p>This is made possible in part by keeping their average page weight low - they report an average of 0.5MB per page - by delivering their pages without a database, without custom fonts, and using an old-timey image compression technique called 'dithering'.</p>

Turns out dithering only reduces file sizes in a "lossless" compression image format (like <abbr title="portable network graphic">PNG</abbr>, as opposed to a lossy format like <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>). But I still can't get the dithered file size smaller than the full-colour, full-resolution versions I generate in modern web image formats {% ext "https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/09/modern-image-formats-avif-webp/" %}<abbr title="AOMedia Video 1 Image File Format">AVIF</abbr> and <abbr title="Iâ€¦ don't know actually.

        </div>
        <p>To be perfectly honest, I actually prefer the aesthetics of their bare-bones solar-powered website to their {% ext "https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/" %}regular website{% endext %} - it feels like I'm reading off a calming e-ink screen (which are, themselves, {% ext "https://www.eink.com/benefits.html#:~:text=compared%20with%20the%20same%20size%20LCD%20screen" %}extremely energy efficient!{% endext %}).</p>
        <p>Is it practical for everyone to run their websites off tiny, solar-powered computers in Barcelona? I wish! But it's a great example of the convergence of many small solutions that can reduce the web's carbon emissions.</p>
