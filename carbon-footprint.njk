        <p>Climate change is a <em>massive</em> topic, so I feel inclined to frame the conversation a bit. When talking about a globe- and epoch-spanning issue, there are things we can affect, and things we can't. Most conversations around climate change are specifically about this: <span data-annotate>what, if anything, can be done, and by whom?</span></p>

    <h2>The web's carbon footprint</h2>
    <p>Four years ago, Mozilla reported that the internet was producing <strong>more carbon emissions than <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-internet-uses-more-electricity-than/" target="_blank">the airline industry<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a></strong>.</p>

    <p>I'm personally of the opinion that any solution that begins with, "If everybody would just..." is no solution at all.</p>
    <p>That's why it's important to keep pressure on big companies to do things like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54141899" target="_blank">wiping out their carbon footprint<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, but I also think it's important to consider the impact you might have if you end up working for (or starting!) a larger company that serves billions of megabytes to millions of people.</p>
    <p>While it would be very cool if everyone's websites were <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/power.html" target="_blank">solar powered<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, the simplest and most accessible way to reduce your website's carbon footprint is by making it smaller.</p>

    <p>When I say "smaller", I don't mean a smaller font-size, or even less content, I mean in terms of "page weight" - <strong>smaller file sizes for your code and assets</strong>.</p>
