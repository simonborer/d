    <p>Climate change is a <em>massive</em> topic, so I feel inclined to frame the conversation a bit.

    {% slide %}
        <p>In 2018, Mozilla reported that internet data centres alone produced <strong>roughly the same carbon emissions as {% ext "https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-internet-uses-more-electricity-than/" %}the airline industry{% endext %}</strong> - about 2% of total emissions.</p>
        <p>This number doesn't factor in all the other devices that form the client end of the web - phones, laptops, personal computers, TVs, watches, {% ext "https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/brita-infinity-wi-fi-connected-pitcher" %}water pitchers{% endext %}, {% ext "https://www.lavviebot.com/en/home.html" %}litterboxes{% endext %}, {% ext "https://www.allure.com/story/kerastase-hair-coach" %}hairbrushes{% endext %}, et al.</p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>At the beginning of 2019, French "post-carbon economy think tank" The Shift Project estimated the total share of global emissions created by the internet to be {% ext "https://theshiftproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lean-ICT-Report_The-Shift-Project_2019.pdf" %}3.7%{% endext %} of the {% ext "https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/co2-emissions-from-energy-combustion-and-industrial-processes-1900-2021" %}36.1 billion metric tons{% endext %} emitted globally, (for a total of about 1.3 billion tons), but that number still doesn't capture the seismic changes in the world over the past three years.</p>

        <h3>Streaming video</h3>
        <p>Actually some good news here: I had assumed that streaming media would be really gnarly for the environment, having read some scary articles a few years back. Turns out, {% ext "https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-carbon-footprint-of-streaming-video-fact-checking-the-headlines#:~:text=Calculate%20your%20emissions" %}watching one hour of Netflix on a big TV in 4K{% endext %} has the same carbon footprint as boiling a kettle twice.

        <h3>Remote work</h3>
        <p>Remote work is still, as of this writing, the subject of a lot of unsettled questions.</p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <h4>Remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic.</h4>
        <p>While 2020 was a {% ext "https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/annual-change-in-co2-emissions-from-energy-combustion-and-industrial-processes-1900-2021" %}great year for carbon emission reduction{% endext %}, with a global reduction of 1.86 gigatonnes from 2019, we bounced back in 2021 in the worst possible way.</p>
        <p>I heard murmurs that this was because so many of us were working from home, but that might not be the case.</p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>Throughout the 20th, and into the 21st century, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions were strongly correlated with <abbr title="gross domestic product">GDP</abbr>.</p>
        <figure>
            {% image "images/co2-emissions-vs-gdp.png", "Graph showing a strong correlation between a country's gross domestic produce and their carbon emissions", "(min-width: 30em) 600px, 100vw", "Our World in Data based on the Global Carbon Project, Maddison Project Database 2020 (Bolt and van Zanden, 2020)" %}

        </figure>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>One of the promising indicators for, you know, human survival is that we are making progress in decoupling those numbers:</p>
        <figure>
            {% image "images/co2-gdp.png", "Graph showing a reduction in kilograms of carbon emitted as a factor of global gross domestic product", "(min-width: 30em) 600px, 100vw", "The World Bank" %}

        </figure>
        <p>However, the rebound in carbon emissions from 2019 to 2020 suggests that CO<sup>2</sup> emissions are less about <em>where</em> people work, and more about <em>whether</em> they work.</p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>That said, where <em>are</em> people going to be working in the years to come?</p>
        <p>In America, the vast majority of people who worked remotely due to COVID-19 are {% ext "https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-remote-workers-declining-may-2022-rcna28499#20220512-work-remote" %}back in the workplace{% endext %}. In Canada, "only one half (50%) of Canadians currently working from home envision themselves returning to the office with any regularity in 2022", according to {% ext "https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/only-half-of-Canadians-say-they-expect-to-return-to-office#:~:text=Toronto%2C%20ON%2C%20December%2026%2C,Ipsos%20poll%20conducted%20on%20behalf" %}an Ipsos poll{% endext %}.</p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>So what does that mean for carbon emissions? While the future of remote work is uncertain, we can definitely say the that working from home is (according to a meta-analysis published in the journal <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>) {% ext "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8a84" %}kinda good, maybe, sometimes, for the most part{% endext %}.</p>
        <p>Turns out that, while reducing commuting is good for the planet, those gains can be partially (or even wholly) offset by other secondary effects like buying new, {% ext "https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/research/publications/rare-earth-elements-a-resource-constraint-of-the-energy-transition/" %}rare earth element intensive{% endext %} home office equipment and home energy use, and an increase in non-work-related travel. The benefits of reduced commutes are smallest in places where there's good public transit, where the reduced ridership can negatively impact lower-emissions transportation.</p>
        <p>In short, this is a hard topic upon which to draw any firm conclusions, particularly, the authors of the meta-analysis note, as work itself becomes harder to pin down. The shift to the "gig economy", contract work, and the expectation in the modern workplace of 24/7 availability - a deliberate blurring of the lines between working and doing literally anything else - makes it hard to determine when someone's carbon emissions are work-related.</p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <p>To summarize: it's a <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--emphasis)">very good thing when people don't drive to work</span>, but those benefits are only as good as the sustainability of <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--alert)">our home office equipment, public transit and electrical grid</span>.</p>
    {% endslide %}
    {% slide %}
        <h3>Web3: Blockchain, Crypto and NFTs</h3>
        <p>Finally, <span data-annotate data-ann-color="var(--alert)">a true villain</span>.</p>
        <p>{% ext "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3" %}"Web3"{% endext %} is a somewhat vague buzzword for blockchain-based... stuff. Blockchain is a {% ext "https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain" %}technology that allows for the decentralized verification of ownership and transaction histories{% endext %}. In other words, everybody gets a copy of a document that shows who owns what and where they got it. This is the technology that underlies most cryptocurrencies ("crypto") and non-fungible tokens ("NFTs"). While web3 is hazy and a bit speculative at the moment, we <em>do</em> have some understanding of NFTs and crypto.</p>
        <h4>Crypto's environmental footpring</h4>
        <p class="callout warning">Full disclosure: I may not know what I'm talking about here. This is a complex topic, so please understand that this is an amateur's best effort at understanding some complicated stuff, and take my words with a grain of salt. I promise I'll update this section if I understand this better in the future.</p>
        <p>Okay, so, best as I can tell - the integrity of a cryptocurrency's blockchain relies on a process called "Proof of Work", wherein there is a bit of a lottery, where the reward is crypto, but you get more lottery tickets based on how much computational power you expend. Do I fully understand how maxing GPUs, solving arbitrary, {% ext "https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=" %}progressively harder{% endext %} computational problems for Bitcoin, {% ext "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp#toc-proof-of-work-faqs" %}somehow verifies transactions{% endext %} (or {% ext "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work" %}prevents spam email{% endext %} for that matter)? Nope. However, the expenditure of computational resources results in the verification of transactions (somehow), and miners receive a free for transactions they verify (I'm reasonably certain).</p>
        <p>What I <em>do</em> know is that running a competition to see who can push the most computers harder and harder over time has not been great for carbon emissions. Researchers estimate that Bitcoin mining (not including all other cryptocurrencies) in 2021 alone was responsible for about {% ext "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358861058_Revisiting_Bitcoin%27s_carbon_footprint" %}65.4 million tonnes of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions{% endext %} - roughly the same as the {% ext "https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/carbon-footprint-by-country#dataTable" %}entire country of Austria{% endext %}. (However, let's keep it in context - 65.4 million is still only 4.9% of 1.3 billion.)</p>
        <p>Another verification method, called Proof of Stake ("PoS"), basically requires you to put up crypto you already own as collateral for the accuracy of your version of the verification ledger. Proof of stake is less energy intensive, but hasn't been widely adopted among cryptocurrencies (although Ethereum, the next largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, is {% ext "https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/" %}planning to switch over to PoS{% endext %}).</p>
        <p>Ethereum is an important part of the NFT market. The Ethereum blockchain enabled "smart contracts" in 2017, which lead to the NFT market of today. These smart contracts aren't necessarily contracts in the traditional sense, but the execution of a computer function on the blockchain itself, meaning that you can trade something more complex than a "coin" (a coin being, in essence, a series of alphanumeric characters).  This opened the door to trading non-fungible tokens. NFTs are digital goods, which... well, they're also a series of alphanumeric characters, but when an NFT is traded, you're executing a smart contract where the {% ext "https://theconversation.com/how-nonfungible-tokens-work-and-where-they-get-their-value-a-cryptocurrency-expert-explains-nfts-157489" %}digital signature of the file{% endext %} (rather than the entirety of the code) is authenticated. I'm pretty sure.</p>
        <p>How much carbon does Ethereum currently produce? Probably about {% ext "https://kylemcdonald.github.io/ethereum-emissions/" %}7.9 million tonnes per year{% endext %} - a fraction of Bitcoin's carbon footprint, but a lot more than nothing (and, hopefully, about 1000 times as much as it <em>will</em> produce after the {% ext "https://fortune.com/2021/05/27/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-proof-of-stake-environment-carbon/" %}long-awaited{% endext %} switch to Proof-of-Stake).</p>
        <p>What percentage of that is due to NFTs? This is not something I could find a lot of sources on. ARTnews {% ext "https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/nft-carbon-environmental-impact-1234589742/#:~:text=represent%20a%20very%20small%20portion%20of%20Ethereum%20transactions%20overall" %}cites estimates ranging from 1%-2.5%{% endext %} of Ethereum transactions being NFT exchanges (the vast majority of the remaining percentage being trades of Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether, a.k.a. ETH).</p>
        <p>But here's where we draw what some people claim as an important distinction - mining vs. transactions. Mining, i.e. the computationally expensive proof-of-work, is the #1 source of crypto's carbon emissions by orders of magnitude. The transactions themselves create a fairly negligible amount of emissions. The mining creates the <em>capacity</em> for the transactions, and the number of transactions doesn't directly affect the size of crypto's carbon footprint.</p>
        <p>That being said, the transactions result in fees paid to the miners, who are incentivized to build out the capacity of the network through Proof of Work. Essentially, this capacity is what results in the massive carbon footprint of blockchain technologies. The reason it's tough to come up with a number to represent the carbon emissions per NFT is that the carbon emissions will still happen without the transactions, but the reason for the carbon emissions is because the transactions incentivize the capacity building.</p>
        <blockquote>
            If you’re on the plane, you’re obviously responsible for a portion of its emissions. But if you hadn’t bought the ticket, the plane probably would have taken off with other passengers and polluted the same amount anyway... If enough people decide to start flying who weren’t planning to before, an airline might decide to operate more flights — which means more emissions overall.

    <h2>The web's carbon footprint</h2>
    <p>Four years ago, Mozilla reported that the internet was producing <strong>more carbon emissions than <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-internet-uses-more-electricity-than/" target="_blank">the airline industry<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a></strong>.</p>

    <p>I'm personally of the opinion that any solution that begins with, "If everybody would just..." is no solution at all.</p>
    <p>That's why it's important to keep pressure on big companies to do things like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54141899" target="_blank">wiping out their carbon footprint<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, but I also think it's important to consider the impact you might have if you end up working for (or starting!) a larger company that serves billions of megabytes to millions of people.</p>
    <p>While it would be very cool if everyone's websites were <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/power.html" target="_blank">solar powered<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>, the simplest and most accessible way to reduce your website's carbon footprint is by making it smaller.</p>

    <p>When I say "smaller", I don't mean a smaller font-size, or even less content, I mean in terms of "page weight" - <strong>smaller file sizes for your code and assets</strong>.</p>
