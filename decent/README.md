# TODO

## Analytics?
### Requirements
- Gotta be GDPR compliant (I do not want that fucking manage cookies pop-up)
- Has to actually return value
### Options/Roadmap
- Probably just gonna turn on Netlify Analytics for the first couple months. $9/site/mo. Apparently (like GA) it logs a lot of bot traffic. Just nice to see where things are coming from when starting social strategy. Nice that there's no JS.
- [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) is $14/mo (many sites), and it's Canadian, so that's nice. Probably a good option if I start advertising and need things to be a little more long-term and granular.
### Before launch?
Yah, throw NA on there at the beginning.

## Site search
### Requirements
- Hide for no-js environment
### Options/Roadmap
- Really just [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/getting-started/different-builds.html)
- See how hard it is to throw things into JSON. If it's a huge pain, it can wait until we've got a decent amount of content.
- [Accessible](https://alphagov.github.io/accessible-autocomplete/examples/)
### Before launch?
Maybe. See Roadmap
